I noticed that gparted supports copy/paste. Being curious about what this could potentially do I gave it a try. I marked partition one on the old disk, did a copy, went to the new disk and clicked on paste - and guess what, gparted did what I was looking for.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Putting a long story short: you can copy whole partitions using gparted's copy/paste mechanism and even resize them whilst doing so. I am somehow ashamed I did not notice this feature earlier, having been a gparted user for a few years now and I can imagine I am not the only one who missed that.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Technology</category><category>gparted</category><category>free software</category><guid>http://blog.sp.or.at/posts/200912how-to-copy-partitions-under-gnulinux.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 01 Dec 2009 16:22:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
