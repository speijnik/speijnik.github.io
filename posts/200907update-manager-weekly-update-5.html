    <p>Firstly I have to apologize again for not providing you with weekly update #4, but again I didn't have the time to write one, so this post is going to sum up everything that happened since my last update.<br><br>Let's have a look at my previous TODO list:<br><br><strong>Documentation</strong><br><br>Even though my TODO list entry contained a more detailed entry I have updated the UpdateManager documentation as a whole, leaving only a few blank spots right now.<br><br><strong>Ubuntu distribution specific code</strong><br><br>I implemented changelog fetching for Ubuntu, which works just as fine as its Debian counterpart now.<br><br><strong>More unit tests</strong><br><br>There are plenty of unit tests now, but not everything is being tested yet. I am especially proud of my Python interface validation code, that is being used in unit tests to check if handlers implement an interface correctly.<br><br><strong>Update list downloading</strong><br><br>Checking for updates is what caused me major trouble in the past few days. Basically I had all the code ready, but for some reason the UI froze, with no apparent reason.<br>However, today I was able to finally identify and fix the problem. As I expected my code was just fine, but python-apt was messing up. I am going to discuss the exact problem and its solution later on, but first: a screenshot. :-)<br></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Checking-for-updates.png"><img alt="Update Manager update check" class="aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-151" height="150" src="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Checking-for-updates-150x150.png" title="Update Manager update check" width="150"></a></p><br><br>Note: As you probably noticed I replaced the default progressbar with a pulsating one, because we cannot get exact information on how many items/bytes to fetch and would likely get a progress bar moving backwards, which isn't beautiful.<br><br><strong>Further changes</strong><br><br>The TODO list was rather short and I did a lot of other work, which I want to elaborate on.<br><br><strong>Dynamic selection of frontend, backend and distribution specific modules</strong><br><br>Even though this is probably not of any interest to John Doe, it helps a great deal when debugging code as all three components can be selected via separate command line switches now.<br>Additionally some magic has been put in place that automatically detects the system's distribution and loads the corresponding distribution specific module. This is done via lsb_release and the newly introduced code in UpdateManager.Util.lsb.<br><br><strong>Pylint cleanup</strong><br><br>Just out of curiosity I decided to start a pylint run on the codebase and quite a few problems were detected, which I then fixed. To be honest though I added quite some code afterwards that probably needs pylint checking and fixes again.<br><br><strong>update-manager IPC</strong><br><br>My original plan and IPC design involved using callback functions and passing them between the different modules. Even though this worked out fine I had the feeling this wasn't clean enough and decided to ditch this approach and replace it with handler classes.<br>The handler base classes now provide an interface of methods that are called on certain events and their implementations act accordingly. The main benefit was that I could easily drop a lot of enums and rather have different methods handling different events.<br><br><strong>Gtk, threads and python-apt</strong><br><br>With the new IPC approach it became easier to use threads that do the actual work in the background, which I had implemented in next to no time, but a few problems showed up.<br>Whilst cache reloading from within a thread worked just fine checking for updates did not, and until today I didn't know why. I spent a good amount of time debugging this issue, even using python profiling, but nothing obvious showed up. The background process was running, whilst the UI froze.<br>Today I finally found the root of the problem: python-apt. Even though I assumed that the python-apt worker threads must be stealing CPU time from the thread running gtk.main I wasn't sure how this could be happening, having two completely independent threads.<br><br>Now, the cause of all this mess was that Python has a global threading lock and it seems as if this one is *LOCKED* when running C-code, such as the one python-apt comes with. The solution lies in calling Py_BEGIN_THREADS_ALLOW and Py_END_THREADS_ALLOW from within the C code, to release the global lock and let the Python interpreter do some work every now and then.<br><br>As with the python-apt acquire code I was able to allow other threads to work as soon as the fetching code starts working and only disallow threads when actually modifying Python objects or calling methods and/or functions. Surprisingly python-apt already made use of this in its cache loading code, but not the fetch progress code.<br>Fixing this problem took me less than half an hour and you probably can't believe how glad I was to finally get things working again.<br><br><strong>UI updates &amp; other changes<br></strong><br><br>Some details in the UI were anything but optimal, like horizontal scrollbars in a few places, which I removed. Additionally I saw the need to move some code out of the Gtk frontend's __init__.py file and to a separate ui.py file.<br>A full list of all changes I made is available from the bzr changelog at <a href="http://bzr.debian.org/loggerhead/update-manager/devel/gsoc09/changes" title="update-manager changes @bzr.debian.org">bzr.debian.org</a>.<br><br><strong>A few more screenshots</strong><br><br>Finally, I would like to provide you with two more screenshots (don't worry about my system being insecure because of not applied updates - this is a testing machine that is  not up-to-date on purpose):<br><br><a href="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Update-Manager-1.png"><img alt="Update Manager main screen" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-149 alignnone" height="150" src="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Update-Manager-1-150x150.png" title="Update Manager main screen" width="150"></a><br><br><a href="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Update-Manager.png"><img alt="Update Manager main screen with details &amp; changelog" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-150 alignnone" height="150" src="http://blog.peijnik.at/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Screenshot-Update-Manager-150x150.png" title="Update Manager main screen with details &amp; changelog" width="150"></a><br><br><strong>TODO list</strong><br><br>My TODO list for next week:<br><ul><br><li>Downloading and installing of updates</li><br><li>Checking that everything is documented</li><br><li>Even more unit tests</li><br><li>Pylint checking</li><br><li>If time permits and everything else works correctly: working on an aptdaemon backend</li><br></ul><ul class="pager"><li class="previous">
