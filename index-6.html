        <p>So, today I am starting off with a new story series. The <a href="http://cetico.org/nwu">nwu</a> development news.<br>Now what is this series about? Well, to make a long story short, it is about what has recently changed in nwu's codebase and how nwu is coming along.<br>Just a sidenote, the first story in this series is of course number 0, as real programmers start counting at 0. :-)<br><br>For those of you who are now wondering what nwu is or could be, I did write about nwu on this weblog already and the 'nwu - an introduction' post should give you a good idea of what it is.<br><br>So, what has changed recently? Basically I merged my changes back into trunk, which means that most of these things are going to be used now. This means that the <strong>application framework</strong>, the <strong>scheduler</strong>, the <strong>APT "Packages" file parser</strong>, <strong>support for gzip compression</strong> in both the SecureXMLRPC client and server and the brand-new <strong>RPC framework</strong> are either already being used, or are going to be used soon.<br><br>Except for the RPC framework, which would need to be adapted, and the application framework, which depends on nwu.common.config, all these pieces of code also work stand-alone and can be used in other python applications too.</p>

        <p>As I promised I am writing about <a href="http://cetico.org/nwu" title="network wide updates">nwu</a> again. But instead of reporting on recent development efforts I would rather like to point something else out today: The <a href="http://cetico.org/nwu/browser/branches/stephan/nwu/common" title="nwu.common module">nwu.common</a> Python module contains code which can be used stand-alone in your applications. Some of the functions the module provides could come in handy, so I thought it was a good idea to let you know.<br><br>This article is going to explain the stand-alone nwu.common.* modules and their function.<br><br><a name="more"></a><strong> nwu.common.SecureXMLRPC</strong><br><br>I would like to start out introducing my "baby": SecureXMLRPC. As the name suggests it provides support for XML-RPC over https. You might think "but that's present in Python's SimpleXMLRPCServer and xmlrpclib already" and you are right about that. However, the Python implementation uses <a href="http://openssl.org/" title="OpenSSL homepage">OpenSSL</a>, whilst SecureXMLRPC provides both a server and client implementation using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/" title="GnuTLS homepage">GnuTLS</a>. Even though the OpenSSL version works perfectly fine you cannot link it to GPL-licensed code due to the OpenSSL license being <a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html" title="license list">incompatible to the GPL</a>.<br>Furthermore SecureXMLRPC supports compression of the XML-RPC payload and as of today is aware of multi-threading.<br><br><strong>nwu.common.config</strong><br><br>The config module provides a single class, "Config". It basically is a slightly improved version of Python's SafeConfigParser class and allows passing a "default value" argument to its get() method which is returned in case the setting is not present in the config.<br><br><strong>nwu.common.app</strong><br><br>This is a simple application framework. It makes use of "nwu.common.config" for reading the config file. However, its main feature is a simple-to-use command-line parser, which parses not only arguments from the command-line (such as --do-something, -d or --configfile=filename), but also supports "commands" as they can be found in several applications, such as aptitude. This way it is easy to not only create top-level commands (like "aptitude <em>search</em> &lt;package name&gt;"), but also nested command structures (like "program <em>computer get</em> &lt;computer name&gt;", "program <em>computer list</em>", etc.).<br><br><strong>nwu.common.certtool</strong><br><br>The certtool module is a wrapper around GnuTLS' certtool application. It allows you to create private keys, certificate authorities, sign certificates, created certificate-signing-requests (CSRs)  and sign such.<br>However, please note that it currently does not implement the full functionality certtool provides but rather only the pieces nwu needs.<br><br><strong>nwu.common.aptmethod</strong><br><br>nwu.common.aptmethod simplifies implementation of an APT transport/method in Python. It takes care of all communication done with apt itself and thus gives you the opportunity to implement a new method in a simple way.<br><br><strong>nwu.common.apt</strong><br><br>Finally there is also the apt module. This module currently contains code to parse APT Packages files.<br><br><strong>nwu.common.scheduler</strong><br><br>One of the latest additions to the common module. It provides a way of scheduling tasks for execution at a certain date/time and executing a task in a given interval.</p>

        <p>I just stumbled accross what seems to be an interesting Free Software news site, named <a href="http://blue-gnu.biz/">Blue-GNU</a>, and wanted to let you know.<br><br>It also seems to be "GNU-approved" as there is a link to it on the (new) <a href="http://gnu.org">gnu.org</a> frontpage.</p>

        <p>This article should give you a brief overview of what <a href="http://cetico.org/nwu" target="_blank">network-wide updates</a>, one of my projects, is about.<br><br>Network wide updates, or nwu, is a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> package licensed under the <a href="http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a> (version 3 or later). It allows an administrator to remotely install software on and roll out security upgrades to managed computers. It is targeted at GNU/Linux systems using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool">Advanced Packaging Tool</a> (APT) for package management and thus should run fine on all GNU/Linux distributions based on <a href="http://debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> (such as <a href="http://gnewsense.org">gNewSense</a> and all <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> flavors).<br><br><a name="more"></a>It further gathers data about all managed computers in a database, which gives the administrator an overview about which systems are managed, the hardware configurations they have, the software installed on them and pending security updates.<br><br>The system is split into two major components: the server, which is the central management point, and the clients, usually referred to as agents, which report to the server.<br><br>Now let's go into nasty technical details. nwu is implemented in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, using XML-RPC and python-gnutls (and this way the <a href="http://gnu.org/software/gnutls">GnuTLS</a> library) for secure communication between the server and its agents. It further makes use of X.509-certificate authentication and provides an integrated CA-system which simplifies use of this method a great deal.<br><br>Currently nwu is in an alpha development stage, but moving forward quite fast. We are expecting to be able to release a stable version quite soon.<br><br>The development team is made up of <a class="ext-link" href="http://cetico.org/tech"><span class="icon">Yves Junqueira</span></a> and myself right now, but we would be happy to accept contributions from others.<br><br>If you are interested in nwu development you should probably watch this blog, as I am going to write about recent developments here.</p>
